## Projects

### LullAi Audiobooks with Real-Time Voice Cloning 
[Github Repo]（https://github.com/linonion/LullAi---Personalized-Audiobooks.git）
**Tech Stack**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, AWS   
- Implemented a real-time TTS and voice-cloning service powered by ElevenLabs APIs, achieving high-fidelity audio with minimal latency.  
- Developed a Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS, enabling user-friendly interfaces for text input, voice parameter customization, and audio streaming features.  
- Collaborated with leadership on the Node.js + Express backend design, emphasizing modularity, concurrency, and robust error handling to ensure reliable service orchestration.  
- Leveraged AWS Lambda for serverless function execution, Amazon S3 for storing generated audio files, and CloudFront to optimize global content delivery.  
- Utilized SQS and SNS for event-driven message queuing and notifications, ensuring reliable, asynchronous handling of voice generation workflows.

### AsyncFrame
[Github Repo]（https://github.com/linonion/Lin-Async-Frame.git)
**Tech Stack**: Java, Spring Boot, Mybatis, Redis, MySQL  
- Developed a lightweight framework for managing asynchronous scenarios in machine learning data processing.  
- Divided framework into two main components: `flowSVR` for task creation and workers handling and consuming existing tasks.  
- Improved system concurrency and reliability by replacing MySQL row-level locks with Redis distributed locks, effectively resolving multi-worker competition issues.  
- Optimized application performance through Redis caching and MySQL connection pooling, increasing throughput from 500 QPS to 2000 QPS.

### B-CNNs for Multi-Label Facial Emotion Recognition
[Github Repo]（https://github.com/linonion/Multi-Label-FER.git）
**Tech Stack**: Python, Google Cloud, PyTorch, OpenCV    
- Implemented baseline models (two ResNet-10 backbones + HOG-based Logistic Regression) and introduced Bilinear Fusion (element-wise multiplication) for second-order feature interactions.  
- Employed Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy Loss with label smoothing, alongside dropout and extensive data augmentation.  
- Achieved an F1 Macro score of 0.72, outperforming traditional baselines by 30%.
